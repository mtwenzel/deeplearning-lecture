# Class 8: Learning paradigms: How to train a neural network?

* Supervised, 
* semi-supervised/weakly supervised,
* unsupervised/self-supervised

## Supervised

## Semi-supervised/weakly supervised
* Multiple-instance learning

## Unsupervised
* Classification/Segmentation: Clustering
* Generative networks: Reconstruction
* Often termed *self-supervised* these days

## Self-supervised
- Facebook's general framework for self-supervised learning, [data2vec](https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/data2vec-a-general-framework-for-self-supervised-learning-in-speech-vision-and-language/)
- UvA Tutorial on [SimCLR](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial17/SimCLR.html)
- Pretraining algorithms, e.g. BERT-style
