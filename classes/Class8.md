# Class 8: Learning paradigms: How to train a neural network?

## Supervised
* Influence of label quality
* Bias/distribution shift: [Causality matters](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17478-w) not only in medical imaging

## Semi-supervised/weakly supervised
* Multiple-instance learning

## Unsupervised/Self-Supervised
* Classification/Segmentation: Clustering
* Generative networks: Reconstruction (e.g. Autoencoders, [Class 9](Class9.md))
* Distribution estimation models (e.g. RBMs using Contrastive Divergence, [Class 3](Class3.md))
* Facebook's general framework for self-supervised learning, [data2vec](https://ai.facebook.com/research/publications/data2vec-a-general-framework-for-self-supervised-learning-in-speech-vision-and-language/)
* UvA Tutorial on [SimCLR](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial17/SimCLR.html)
* Pretraining algorithms, e.g. BERT-style
