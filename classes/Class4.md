# Class 4: CNNs for Classification

## Image analysis in general
- Metrics and how to select them are the topic of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01653.pdf).

## CNNs for classification
- [TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/)
- [CNN Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/)
- UvA tutorial on [classification networks](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html)
- Classifiers can't easily signal out-of-distribution examples. [Preview: Energy-based models help.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03263) Cf. Contrastive Divergence!
- Classifier calibration
