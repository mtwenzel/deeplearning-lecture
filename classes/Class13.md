# Class 13

Introductory remarks
* associational/correlational analysis is limited
* world consists of part-whole relations; inter-subject relations; causal relations
* in this lecture: approaches that (try to) respect this

## Class 13.1: Graph Neural Networks

* Why [Graph Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261) are suited to real-world problems. Differentiable Graph Module explained in a [nice blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/manifold-learning-2-99a25eeb677d) by one of the authors.
* Corresponding DeepMind [Graph Nets Github](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets), and the [Blog series on Graph Neural Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-deep-learning/home)
* [Graph networks combined with symbolic regression](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/c9f2f917078bd2db12f23c3b413d9cba-Abstract.html) to model physical laws

## Class 13.2: Capsule Networks

By the original authors:
* [Capsule Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/2cad8fa47bbef282badbb8de5374b894-Abstract.html) with [EM routing](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJWLfGWRb)
